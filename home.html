Marshall Bruce Mathers 2 a.k.a "Eminem" or "SlimShady" has a story that is truly one of a kind and that of a rags to riches story. He was born on 17th October 1972 in St. Joseph, 
Missouri, U.S.A. In 1996 he released his debut studio LP titled "Infinite".
 Although it did not commercially and pubicly appeal to the acclaim of the majority of the critical masses, it did somehow reach the ears and hands of well
recognised record executives. Two years later, he would record and release his "Slim Shady EP", much to the dismay and impression of Interscope Records and Aftermath Records 
Jimmy Iovine and "Dr. Dre`" respectively. That did not hesitate to have immediately found and one year later he released his first major label studio album "The Slim Shady LP" 
in 1999. It would be the album to put Eminem on the global mainstream musical map. A few achievements and accolades later, Eminem released the best and biggest selling Hip-Hop 
and Rap album of all time, "The Marshall Mathers LP" (1 760 000) sales in less that one week and 5 Grammy awards in one night. Years later Eminem has gone on to become one of 
the beast and biggest selling recording artists of all time. All this before the age of 50!
