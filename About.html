Eminem's musical career oficially took off in the year of 1997 at Scribble Jam's Rap Olympics in Los Angeles, California. Eminem had made to the final against Juice.
Although he would ultimately end up as runner's up, he had gained the respect of Juice that same day, so much that Juice rates him as the best emcee he has ever battled.
Fast forward 25 years and Eminem is one of the 20th century's greatest and highest selling recording artist of all time. With 15 Grammy Awards, 8 Americam Music Awards, 
17 Billboard MUsic Awards, an Academy Award, 5 World Music Awards and over 220 million record sales, all this before the age of 50.
